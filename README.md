# validating-base

A simple Validating Base Class library. Enables runtime validation of argument types using [typeguard](https://pypi.org/project/typeguard/).

All you need to do is inherit from the [`validating_base.ValidatingBaseClass`](./src/validating_base/base.py?plain=1#L82) class, type hint ([more info](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)) all the methods, and then specify the methods that you want to validate using the decorators found in the [`validating_base.decorators`](./src/validating_base/decorators.py) module.

See the [tests](./tests/test_base.py) for some better examples of usage.

## Installation

To install the project you only need to clone the repo and run pip install within the repo folder:

```bash
pip install .
```

Or you can install directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/alexfayers/validating-base
```

## Usage

You use validating-base by importing the base class and inheriting from it.

Below is an example, taken from the project's tests, that shows simple usage.

Anything that inherits from `ValidatingBaseClass` will need to implement an `action` method (because this is specified in the `required_methods` class variable).

This method will have it's argument types validated at runtime using simple type checking (because the method is specified in the `validated_methods` class variable) (this step is provided by typeguard).

If the first type checking step passes with no exceptions, then the `validate_action` method will be called. This method validates that the `number_list` argument is a list of integers.

Finally, the return type of the `action` method is validated using typeguard.

```py
from validating_base import ValidatingBaseClass

class ActionExample(ValidatingBaseClass):
    """Shows an example usage of the `validating_base.ValidatingBaseClass` class."""

    required_methods: list[str] = ["action"]
    validated_methods: list[str] = ["action"]

    def validate_action(self, number_list: list[int]) -> None:
        """Validate that the data to be processed is in the correct format.

        Args:
            number_list (List[int]): The list of ints

        Raises:
            TypeError: Raised if the data is not the correct type
            ValueError: Raised if the types are correct, but there is an issue in the formatting
        """
        for number in number_list:
            if not isinstance(number, int):
                raise TypeError(f"{number} is not an integer")
```

Most of the time, an abstract base class will work. But, if you want the runtime validation then this library might be useful.
